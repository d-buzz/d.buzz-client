# D.Buzz Frontend

This is the frontend codebase that powers the D.Buzz social platform. It is built using React and Redux.

## Overview and Main Pages

The project's frontend is structured around several key pages, each serving a distinct purpose within the D.Buzz platform:

- **Home (`Home`)**: This page component shows the latest posts across the platform.
- **Landing (`Landing`)**: This page is similar to the Home page but is specifically tailored for unauthenticated users, showcasing trending posts to give a glimpse of the platform's activity.
- **Profile (`Profile`)**: The user profile page provides detailed information about users, including their posts, replies, wallet transactions, and settings. It also includes sub-routes for additional profile-related views.
- **Wallet (`Wallet`)**: Users can view their wallet balances and transaction history on this page, managing their Hive blockchain financial activities.
- **Search (`Search`)**: This page allows users to search for posts and other users on the platform, providing a search results page to display the findings.
- **Content (`Content`)**: A detailed view for individual posts or comments, including the ability to view and post replies.

The frontend utilizes Redux for global state management, with Sagas handling data fetching asynchronously. React Router is employed for navigation and routing across the platform, ensuring users can smoothly transition between pages. Additionally, the `components/` directory contains reusable UI components that are utilized throughout the application to maintain a consistent look and feel.

## Data Fetching

Data is fetched from the D.Buzz endpoint server using Redux Sagas. The main requests are handled in `services/api.js`, which contains the API calls to the D.Buzz server. These calls are made to the D.Buzz endpoint server which provides the necessary API calls that are not available through the standard Hive blockchain API.

The API calls include fetching posts, comments, user profiles, and other related data. The `SEARCH_API` uses the D.Buzz endpoint server to provide the necessary API calls that are not available through the standard Hive blockchain API. The data is retrieved using JSON-RPC calls over HTTP to `rpc.d.buzz`. The responses from these calls are then processed and managed within the Redux store, with related actions and reducers located in `store/*.js`.

The `services/api.js` file abstracts the complexity of direct blockchain interactions and provides simple methods that are used throughout the application to request and receive data from the Hive blockchain.

## Components

Reusable components are located in `components/`. This includes common UI elements in `elements/` as well as core containers like:

### Pages
- `Home` - The main landing page component for authenticated users.

## Styling

The site uses JSS for styling components. The main theme file with base styles is `services/theme.js` and components define styles using `react-jss`.

## Development

Before starting the dev server, make sure you setup `.env.development` and `.env.production` files with your own variables.

To run locally:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start the dev server at http://localhost:3000.

To run tests:

```
yarn test
```

This will execute the test suite and output the results.

## Embedding the Buzz Button

The Buzz Button allows users to easily share content on DBuzz from any website. To embed the Buzz Button, include the following anchor element with the `dbuzz-share-button` class in your HTML:

```html
<a class="dbuzz-share-button" href="WEB_INTENT_URL">Buzz</a>
```

Replace `WEB_INTENT_URL` with the URL to the DBuzz Web Intent Composer. You can customize the button using `data-*` attributes for text, size, hashtags, and minimum character count.

Include the `buzzWidget.js` script in your page template to enable the Buzz Button:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="BUZZ_WIDGET_JS_URL"></script>
```

Replace `BUZZ_WIDGET_JS_URL` with the URL to the `buzzWidget.js` script.

## Build & Deploy

To create a production build:

```
yarn build 
```

The app is configured to build from the `master` branch.

## Lite Accounts with MetaMask and Ceramic Network

D.Buzz now supports lite accounts, allowing users to log in using their MetaMask wallets and interact with the Ceramic Network. This integration provides a seamless experience for users who prefer to use their Ethereum credentials and decentralized identity profiles.

### MetaMask Login

Users can easily log in to D.Buzz using their MetaMask wallet. This feature leverages the widely-used Ethereum wallet to authenticate users without the need for traditional sign-up processes.

### Ceramic Network Integration

Ceramic Network is a decentralized data network that enables the creation, hosting, and sharing of data without centralized control. By integrating with Ceramic, D.Buzz allows users to manage their decentralized identities and store data in a secure, user-controlled environment.

## Accessing Lite Accounts

To work with lite accounts, you need to switch to the `lite` branch in the project repository. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```sh
git checkout lite
```

This will switch your local workspace to the `lite` branch where you can make changes and test lite account features.
